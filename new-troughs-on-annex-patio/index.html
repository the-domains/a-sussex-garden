<p>We are at the end of April and we are experiencing another set of April weather. Today we have had sunshine, rain, sleet and small hail stones.</p><p>The slightly enthusiastic junior gardener has decided that her troughs needed some work to be done on them. They were neglected last year as we were doing the "house move" and a lot of work was done on the house and some of the garden was left to its own devices.</p><p>We are part of the NGS Garden Scheme and this puts a "time pressure" on the work to be done to get the garden presentable. This year we have been fortunate and a lot of work has already been done.</p><p>The Front (Spring Garden) has been ready for a while, though a lot of work was done, including a lot of new shrubs been planted to fill in the beds. During the storm earlier this year we had a shrub damaged and this required some TLC. The 2 magnolias in the front have been out and "Sayonara" has been particularly spectacular this year.</p><p>We are waiting for our new beech hedge to break, (not literally), but to come out of dormancy. Part of the reason for the wish of the hedge to break is 2-fold.</p><ul><li>1 - it is always an anxious wait when a new set of planting to breathe into life.</li><li>2 -We have a neighbour who has planted a row of beech saplings and expect it to develop into a fully blown hedge on its own.</li></ul><p>During the same storm we had 2 poplars on the edge of the "common" field come down. 1 dropped in the storm and in the process brought down a 2nd tree. This is something we are going to see how it affects the garden, as they are part of the shelter belt which protects the garden from the prevailing south westerly winds.</p><p>The fallen trees dropped across our neighbour's garden, though a few small branches and twigs got caught in the hedge protecting the secret garden. With the exception of the shrub in the front garden we were very fortunate.</p><p>Anyway back to the work of this weekend. We had a set of 3 troughs which are in the "courtyard" area, which really needed to be moved. They were not really getting enough light and made it harder to use the area as the "winter store" area for the "tender" plants. They were disinterred, emptied of most of their soil and they were moved to a new location in front of the annexe to help hide the legs of the "climber - TBD)" which is intended to be planted in the new annexe bed. After a certain amount of work we managed to move the troughs to their new locale. She has replanted the troughs. And with the assistance of generation 2 gardener, they have been netted in order to prevent local wildlife from destroying the plants.</p><p>5 other troughs were also tackled. 2 small ones on the annexe terrace at the end of the main garden beech hedge. They are treated a shade troughs, as the beech hedge is acts as a good parasol for them.</p><picture>

<p>Further down the garden in the shade bed under the Bay tree, we have 3 large troughs. They have been protected for a while, but they have been in need of attention. When we started the troughs, the weather changed quickly and the sleet arrived and made the work ever so enjoyable.....</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 data-reactid="28"><a data-reactid="29">A Sussex Garden</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="33"></div></section></div></div>
