### A potted history of the garden

The house was built in 1949 -- the first one of six in a cornfield - by generation 1\. The plot is on the south edge of a small Sussex village. The house and garden face south with a distant view of the South Downs.

For those interested in soil... we are on quite heavy clay mixed with and overlaying a sandstone base - it can be a little heavy and drainage is slow but its not too bad and it improves well with work.

The garden was laid out in 1950 and the bones remain -- the boundaries are thorn hedge, the plot is sub-divided by the original beech hedge and we are lucky to have several mature trees. The terrace by the house, the general shape of the borders and the lawns would all be recognisable to generation one.

However the house was added to in the 1980s and the annexe garden was originally the vegetable patch and fruit cage, what is now the lower lawn/meadow was planted with fruit trees (the last Bramley apple tree came down in the 1987 gale); and we now have a strip of the field and a little bit of woodland (the area is held in common with the other houses in the street) which was acquired in the late '60s.

The major changes started in the 80s when generation 2 and 3 (then a child) moved back necessitating the building of the annexe and the conversion of the vegetable patch into the garden. As generation 1 aged, the younger ones helped more and more with the maintenance of the whole garden but it was very much under generation 1's control until the mid 1990s but for the last 15 years it was really maintenance only. In 1995 we (that is mother and daughter) took over properly, by which time it was very run-down so we were faced with a huge rehabilitation programme. We made a list of what needed to be done and took turns as to which project to attempt next.

Over the winter of 1997/8 the front garden was attacked -- it was full of overgrown rhododendrons, tree seedlings and head-high nettles so the main bed was cleared almost completely, a low brick wall built, a ton of topsoil brought in to raise the level and it was replanted with shrubs and trees with woodlanders underneath -- it looks at its best in late February and March (aka early Spring). The west side in front of the annexe was left until 2002 when it received similar treatment. The front boundary where a old conifer hedge is taking too much light and nutrient from the area overall is on the list of future projects.

In late 1998 we closed the small herbaceous border in the annex garden and used the plants to plug the gaps in the main herbaceous border. The annexe border was planted up with shrubs and trees, We tinkered unsatisfactorily with the herbaceous border until April 2006 when we finally bit the bullet, dug up the whole lot and took it out onto tarpaulins on the lawn, split up the huge clumps, dug over the border with added chicken manure, replanted what we wanted to retain, mulched with mushroom compost, invited neighbours to come with barrows and bear away the surplus and started on the enthralling task of filling the gaps with plants we wanted but hadn't had the room for previously.

In between these major tasks we dug gravel beds for alpines, added the trough collection, widened and restocked the whole of the east side shrub border which runs half the length of the garden from the house to the myrtle. The shade boarder at the bottom of the main lawn was widened, the level was raised and it was restocked with more unusual and interesting plants. The area under the myrtle is a struggle because of the roots so we have troughs and plan a stumpery and possibly a camellia which is one of the few shrubs capable of dealing with the myrtle roots.

In the lower area of the garden we gave up mowing the "orchard" and started encouraging the wild flowers -- we are augmenting this with seeds and plan the addition of plug plants to get a more varied selection of native plants. We enlarged the pond in 1999, and the bed surrounding this has been evolving ever since. The annex shrub boarder was extended to the full length of the garden - to join up with the pond area - some four years ago and remains something of a challenge due to the clay soil.

To the west of the pond there is a large rhododendron which is one of the original plants - we had have cut a path running through the shrub last year by raising the "skirts" and under-planting with shade lovers including ferns, hostas and primulas. This forms the new access into the Secret Garden (the original path was behind the pond but became impassable ....the plants had grown so enthusiastically).

## The Secret Garden

The "Secret Garden" was created by the youngest generation over the summer of 1995 in an attempt to acquire a small private place. Before the field became available this area was the Engine Room (compost heaps, leaf bins, bonfire site, pot store, etc) but had degenerated into a repository for all sorts of rubbish. We hired a skip and between the removal of old French doors, piles of rubble, squillions of pots, old cold frames and even bedsteads, the site preparation and acquisition/cleaning/positioning of about 350 old bricks a little "jewel box" of an area was created. The plants are mainly alpines and its extremely labour intensive due to the layout. The area suffered badly in the recent wet winters (which coming on top of a degree of neglect due to a serious back injury) necessitated a complete renovation at the end of last year which is now showing to good effect.

The gazebo to the east of the pond is out latest venture. The little building went up in June and the bed followed almost immediately to soften the outline and pull it into the rest of the garden (and hide the path that runs behind it into the field) it is still very much a work in progress.

And finally if you walk out into the field you will find the compost heaps, bonfire site, pot store etc. including a thriving row of runner beans and a rhubarb that is busy getting established!

The above doesn't of course tell the full story.... but its enough to get you started and might help you figure out what you are looking at in the photos.
